Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

0 T-shirt/top
1 Trouser
2 Pullover
3 Dress
4 Coat
5 Sandal
6 Shirt
7 Sneaker
8 Bag
9 Ankle boot

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total.
Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. 
This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255. 
The training and test data sets have 785 columns. 
The first column consists of the class labels (see above), and represents the article of clothing. 
The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.

To locate a pixel on the image, suppose that we have decomposed x as x = i * 28 + j, where i and j are integers between 0 and 27. The pixel is located on row i and column j of a 28 x 28 matrix.
For example, pixel31 indicates the pixel that is in the fourth column from the left, and the second row from the top, as in the ascii-diagram below.

Each row is a separate image
Column 1 is the class label.
Remaining columns are pixel numbers (784 total).
Each value is the darkness of the pixel (1 to 255)

no es necesario armar las imagenes lo hace solo el algoritmo

hay 6000 muestras de cada prenda, por lo que esta balanceado

se puede usar el test set de kaggle para testear??

problema de multisalida??
